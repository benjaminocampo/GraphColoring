## Compilation
gcc -IWahlaan -Wall -Wextra -O3 -std=c99 *.c

After compiling the project you will have an executable file to run it.
The input rules are specified in the "STATEMENT.pdf". There are two
directories in the repository, one of them contains the source code of the project (that
you have to include in the compilation), the other one contains different
input examples.
